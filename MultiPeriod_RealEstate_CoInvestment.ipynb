    "Case: Multi‑period Real‑Estate Co‑Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "A developer can buy fractional shares of three projects—an office tower (O), a hotel (H), and a shopping center (S). Buying a share of any project commits the firm to fund four staged investments (now, year 1, year 2, year 3) in proportion to its share. Each project also has a total net present value (NPV) for a 100% stake; a partial stake earns that same fraction of NPV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm has separate capital budgets available at each time point (now: $25M; year 1: $20M; year 2: $20M; year 3: $15M). Unused funds at one time do not carry forward.\n",
